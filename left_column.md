### Format

Hands-on informal and interactive online two-day event with type-along type of
presentations, live coding and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical
exercises.


### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop
participants with best practices and tools for version control in modern
research software development. The main focus is on using Git for efficiently
writing and maintaining research software.  The material is most of the CodeRefinery lesson [Introduction to version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/).


### **Software requirements**

Please follow the links below and make sure that you install all the required software packages
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation page.

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/)
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
